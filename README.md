# 🩺 Healthcare Data Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to uncover key insights about patient visits, medical center performance and satisfaction trends.  
By exploring metrics such as **visit frequency**, **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** and **center-level performance**, the goal is to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare management.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify trends in patient visits and service categories  
- Analyze satisfaction levels using NPS scores  
- Evaluate performance variations across different medical centers  
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve service quality and efficiency  

---

## 🧠 Approach
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Visualized visit patterns, center performance, and NPS distributions.  
3. **Statistical Insights:** Conducted bivariate and trend analysis for meaningful interpretation.  
4. **Visualization:** Created dashboards and charts in Python and Excel for stakeholder reporting.
